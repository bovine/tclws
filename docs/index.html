<H1>Tcl Web Services</H1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The distribution provides both client side access to Web Services and server
side creation of Web Services. Currently only document/literal and rpc/encoded
with HTTP Soap transport are supported on the client side. The server side
currently works only with TclHttpd or embedded into an application.
The server side provides all services as document/literal
over HTTP Soap transport. Documentation for the package, including examples can
be found here.
